Hello  BurntSushi ~  this is a test repo for my issue which describe in [issue 189](https://github.com/BurntSushi/rust-csv/issues/189)

here is my test data with test code in example folder



here is my test result :

MacBookPro 2019 i9 CPU/ 64G  |  CLION IDE

It took 9340 ms


this is about 9 second for 890000 about rows, but while i add algo in the iter loop, it just add a little bit times


the algo is about (Trading Backtest/ Account updates/ Order Process)  in 3 seconds

so, i don't know why it needs 9 seconds to iter/put it into a struct


thanks
